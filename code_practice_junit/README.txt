I began my preparation for the OCAJP SE 7 Programmer 1 exam. I read a comment
in the coderanch emphasizing the need for LOTS of coding practice. So, I'm doing
that.

I bought books, but they have yet to arrive. In the mean time, I'm preparing
with online stuff from Oracle. I commited to myself to compile, run, and understand
every bit of code I come across.

To make the most of that committment, I am taking the time to set up all of my
code following the Maven conventions for directory structure. This will take
more time now, but will pay off later.

I created an empty directory structure called "maven_dir_template". The contents
of that template comes from recommendations I found online by Googling:

"maven standard directory layout"
http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html
I followed this for the src directory, but it lacked anything for the target directory

"maven target directory layout"
http://www.jajakarta.org/turbine/en/turbine/maven/reference/dirlayout.html
I followed this for the target directory. NOTE: I think Maven autogenerates this
dir structure; I expect to encounter this later when I work in Eclipse or Netbeans.
However, I'm currently doing everything by hand (javac, jar, java, etc.) so
that I get a complete understanding. As such, I'll use this target dir
structure to gain that understanding.
